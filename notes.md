    FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
        Add a random study tip on each reload like Jena said similar to NPM randomizer
        Expand the locations that can be used
        Expand the searchable criteria?
        Allow users to look for study partners who are studying the same thing? Dont get murdered?
        Add friends so you can look at their study spots and meet them (can allow live status, etc.)
    *** NEW IDEAS ***
        A roulette that chooses the location at random based on your search criteria, plus what music to listen to, plus a third thing (not sure what)

USE:
    TomTom API -- Add API Key to .env
    Mockaroo -- Build seeds!

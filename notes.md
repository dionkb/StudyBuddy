MVP:
    User can create and account or log in
    User can GET data from db with info on locations containing [location, wifi?, outlets?, food?, best times?, etc.]
    User can POST the same stuff to add it to db for other users to look at
    User can PUT (update) to add/change reviews?

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
    BACK-END
        COMPLETE: Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
        COMPLETE: Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.
        COMPLETE: Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
        COMPLETE: Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
        COMPLETE: Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed. (TOMTOM API COUNTS)
        COMPLETE: Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
         COMPLETE: Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
        TODO: Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables. (Completed locally, but will need to use JawsDB link that TA's sent last week)

    FRONT-END
        COMPLETE: Have a polished UI. (Looks good, almost everything we need to function, does)
        COMPLETE: Be responsive. (Seems to be good everywhere from what I can tell...bootstrap has it defaulted to be pretty responsive)
        COMPLETE: Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).  

    FINAL
        TODO: Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
        COMPLETE: Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
        TODO: Have a professional README (FIXME: add screenshot, and link to deployed application.)

    FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
        Add a random study tip on each reload like Jena said similar to NPM randomizer
        Expand the locations that can be used
        Expand the searchable criteria?
        Allow users to look for study partners who are studying the same thing? Dont get murdered?
        Add friends so you can look at their study spots and meet them (can allow live status, etc.)
    *** NEW IDEAS ***
        A roulette that chooses the location at random based on your search criteria, plus what music to listen to, plus a third thing (not sure what)

USE:
    TomTom API -- Add API Key to .env
    Mockaroo -- Build seeds!
